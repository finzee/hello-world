# hello-world
Just saying hello to everyone.

It was a cloudy morning, when I woke up with a horrible hangover. That damn whisky again. I tried to grab some coffee, but I didn't find any coffee filters. Why the hell are they always in different places in different kitchens - and by the way, whose kitchen is this?
